This repository contains all the tasks that are done and submitted to Codsoft under the Artificial Intelligence Internship at Codsoft

1. **Tic Tac Toe Game with Unbeatable MinMax AI**

This project is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring an unbeatable AI opponent powered by the MinMax algorithm. The MinMax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that recursively explores all possible game scenarios and selects the optimal move, ensuring that the AI always plays perfectly. The game is built using Python and offers an engaging and challenging experience for players of all skill levels. Whether you're a seasoned Tic Tac Toe player or a newcomer to the game, this project allows you to test your strategic skills against a formidable artificial intelligence opponent.

2. **Rule-Based Support Chatbot**

This project is a rule-based chatbot designed to provide automated support for various domains or products. The chatbot utilizes a set of predefined rules and patterns to understand user queries and provide relevant responses. It is built using Python and can be easily integrated into websites, mobile applications, or messaging platforms. The rule-based approach allows for precise and predictable responses, making it suitable for scenarios where accuracy and consistency are crucial. This chatbot can assist users with common inquiries, and troubleshooting issues, or guide them through specific processes, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and reducing the workload on human support teams.

3.**Image captioning**

Models used and their description:
a) BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model:

Specifically, "Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base" is used
This is a multimodal model designed for vision-language tasks
It's capable of understanding both images and text, allowing it to generate captions for images

b) AutoProcessor:

Used for preprocessing inputs for the BLIP model
Handles tokenization of text and preparation of image data


How image captioning works briefly:
a) Image input:

The image is loaded and converted to RGB format

b) Preprocessing:

The AutoProcessor prepares the image data for the model

c) Model processing:

The BLIP model takes the processed image as input
It analyzes the visual features of the image

d) Caption generation:

The model generates a sequence of tokens representing the caption
This process is guided by the model's understanding of both visual and linguistic features

e) Decoding:

The generated tokens are decoded back into human-readable text

f) Output:

The final caption is returned as a string

The process leverages the pre-trained BLIP model's ability to understand visual content and generate relevant textual descriptions. The model has been trained on large datasets of image-caption pairs, allowing it to learn the relationship between visual features and descriptive language.

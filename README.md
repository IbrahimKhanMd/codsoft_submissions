This repository contains all the tasks that are done and submitted to Codsoft under the Artificial Intelligence Internship at Codsoft

1. **Tic Tac Toe Game with Unbeatable MinMax AI**

This project is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring an unbeatable AI opponent powered by the MinMax algorithm. The MinMax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that recursively explores all possible game scenarios and selects the optimal move, ensuring that the AI always plays perfectly. The game is built using Python and offers an engaging and challenging experience for players of all skill levels. Whether you're a seasoned Tic Tac Toe player or a newcomer to the game, this project allows you to test your strategic skills against a formidable artificial intelligence opponent.

2. **Rule-Based Support Chatbot**

This project is a rule-based chatbot designed to provide automated support for various domains or products. The chatbot utilizes a set of predefined rules and patterns to understand user queries and provide relevant responses. It is built using Python and can be easily integrated into websites, mobile applications, or messaging platforms. The rule-based approach allows for precise and predictable responses, making it suitable for scenarios where accuracy and consistency are crucial. This chatbot can assist users with common inquiries, and troubleshooting issues, or guide them through specific processes, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and reducing the workload on human support teams.
